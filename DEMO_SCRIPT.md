4. Ensure audio is off (or have spooky music ready)
5. Full screen the browser

---

## Opening Hook (15 seconds)

**Say:**
> "The internet never forgets... it just needs a séance. Let me show you what happens when we resurrect a dead website."

**Do:**
- Show the landing page
- Point out the Gothic terminal theme
- Highlight the tagline

---

## Act 1: The Summoning (30 seconds)

**Say:**
> "Let's bring back MySpace from 2009. Watch what happens when we summon a ghost..."

**Do:**
1. Type `myspace.com` slowly
2. Hover over the "👻 Summon" button
3. Click and immediately say:

**Say:**
> "This isn't just a loading screen - it's a full resurrection ritual."

**Point out:**
- The rotating pentagram
- The ancient runes spinning
- The floating code fragments
- The energy pulses
- The cycling messages

**Say:**
> "Every element here is pure CSS - no libraries, just mystical mathematics."

---

## Act 2: The Awakening (10 seconds)

**When success animation appears:**

**Say:**
> "And... RESURRECTION COMPLETE!"

**Point out:**
- The growing circle
- The checkmark
- The triumphant message

**Say:**
> "This moment of celebration makes the wait feel rewarding."

---

## Act 3: The Autopsy (45 seconds)

**When autopsy appears:**

**Say:**
> "But here's where it gets really interesting. We don't just show you the site - we perform a full digital autopsy."

**Scroll through sections slowly:**

### Vital Statistics
**Say:**
> "First, the vital statistics. MySpace died in 2009, but lived for 15 years. We found 127 snapshots preserved in the Wayback Machine."

### Tech Stack
**Say:**
> "We auto-detect the technology based on the era. This ghost speaks in PHP 4, MySQL, Flash, and early JavaScript."

### Cause of Death
**Say:**
> "And here's my favorite part - the cause of death. This one died from migration - it moved to a new realm. The death certificate even has an official stamp."

### Spirit Essence
**Say:**
> "Finally, the spirit essence. Based on the snapshot count, we calculate the spirit's strength. This one is 'Strong' - it was well-documented."

**Point out:**
- The animated progress bar
- The rotating official seal
- The examiner signature

## Act 4: The Ghost (20 seconds)

**Scroll down to iframe:**

**Say:**
> "And of course, here's the actual resurrected site, pulled from the Wayback Machine. You can interact with it, explore it, and even chat with the ghost about its past."

**Optional:** Click around the iframe briefly

---

## Closing (20 seconds)

**Say:**
> "So we took a simple idea - viewing old websites - and transformed it into an experience. Every loading screen is a séance. Every data point is part of an autopsy. Every resurrection is a story."

**Pause for effect:**

**Say:**
> "Because the internet never forgets... it just needs a digital necromancer."

## Q&A Prep

### "How long did this take?"
> "The core functionality took a few hours. These visual enhancements - the ritual and autopsy - took about 30 minutes with Kiro AI."

### "What tech stack?"
> "React for the frontend, pure CSS3 for animations, and the Wayback Machine API for data. No animation libraries - just creative keyframes."

### "Can you resurrect any site?"
> "Any site that's been archived by the Wayback Machine. We've tested it with GeoCities, Friendster, Vine, and more."

### "What's the Gothic Archaeologist persona?"
> "It's our design system. We treat dead websites as artifacts worthy of respect, using mystical language and supernatural themes throughout."

### "Is this production-ready?"
> "The animations are production-ready. We'd need to add error handling, rate limiting, and caching for a full production deployment."

### "What's next?"
> "Sound effects, easter eggs for famous sites, shareable autopsy cards, and maybe AI-powered historical analysis."

## Backup Demo Sites

If MySpace doesn't work:

1. **geocities.com** - Classic 90s site
2. **friendster.com** - Early social network
3. **vine.co** - Recent death (2017)
4. **digg.com** - 2000s tech site
5. **google.com/reader** - Beloved RSS reader

---

## Technical Deep Dive (If Asked)

### Animation Architecture
> "The pentagram is an SVG with CSS transforms. The runes are positioned with trigonometry - 12 elements at 30-degree intervals. The code fragments use CSS custom properties for positioning."

### Performance
> "All animations are GPU-accelerated using transforms and opacity. No JavaScript animation loops. The ritual runs at 60fps even on mobile."

### Responsive Design
> "We scale the ritual from 400px on desktop to 300px on mobile. All text remains readable, and touch targets are appropriately sized."

### State Management
> "We orchestrate three states: loading (ritual), completing (success), and complete (autopsy). The timing is carefully choreographed for maximum impact."

2. Start resurrection (5s)
3. Show ritual briefly (10s)
4. Jump to autopsy (10s)

### Full Demo (2 minutes)
- Follow full script above

### Technical Demo (5 minutes)
- Show code structure
- Explain animation techniques
- Demonstrate responsive behavior
- Show different eras

## Presentation Tips

1. **Speak slowly** - Let animations breathe
2. **Use pauses** - Build anticipation
3. **Point physically** - Guide attention
4. **Show enthusiasm** - Energy is contagious
5. **Tell stories** - "MySpace was where I..."
6. **Make eye contact** - Connect with judges
7. **Smile** - This is fun!

---

## Troubleshooting During Demo

### If ritual doesn't appear:
> "Let me refresh - sometimes the spirits are shy."

### If API is slow:
> "The Wayback Machine is thinking... this gives you more time to appreciate the ritual."

### If iframe doesn't load:
> "The ghost is camera-shy, but you can see all the autopsy data here."

### If nothing works:
> "Let me show you the code instead - the animations are even more impressive when you see how they're built."

## Post-Demo Actions

1. **Share the URL** - Let judges try it
2. **Show the code** - If they're interested
3. **Mention Kiro** - Built with AI assistance
4. **Thank them** - Always be gracious
5. **Stay available** - For follow-up questions

## Success Metrics

You nailed it if judges:
- ✅ Say "wow" or "cool"
- ✅ Lean forward to see better
- ✅ Ask to try it themselves
- ✅ Take photos/videos
- ✅ Mention it to other judges
- ✅ Remember your project name

## The Money Shot

**The moment that wins:**

When the pentagram appears and starts rotating, and you say:

> "This is what happens when you combine digital archaeology with mystical aesthetics."

That's when you've got them. 🎭✨
